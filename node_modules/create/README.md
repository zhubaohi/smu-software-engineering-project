# `create`

This package serves as a warning to developers who accidentally run `npx create` instead of `npm create`:

```plaintext
❌ You just ran npx create, which installs and run this npm package named 'create'.
You likely want npm create, the built-in npm command to install and run a package with a name like 'create-*'.
See: https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/commands/npm-init
```
